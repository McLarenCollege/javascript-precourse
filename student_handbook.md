- If you are absent you will have to spend extra time outside of class hours to make up for missed coursework
- You must have a good internet connect and fast computer with good audio and video capability 
- We may drop you from the course at any time if we find your attendance or work unsatisfactory, or if your behaviour is unprofessional


### Assignment Deadlines
Assignments are due on the day you receive them at 11:59 pm GMT (for students in Europe or Africa) or 9:00 pm IST (for students in Asia).  If we find your submission unacceptable (usually below a grade of 70%) we will give you a catch-up assigment due on the weekend.  All assignments must be graded 'complete' by 5:00 pm IST on the third day after it is published. 

### The 3-Strike Rule
We will drop you from the course if you accrue 3 strikes.  We will give you a strike if:
- You fail to submit a 'complete' assignment by 5:00 pm IST on the third day after it is published 
- You are absent without any prior notice

## Cheating is Unacceptable

> "We look for three things when we hire people. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we 
> look for integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you're going to 
> get someone without integrity, you want them lazy and dumb."
>  -- [Warren Buffett](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-hire-people-with-integrity-heres-how-to-find-them-9?r=AU&IR=T) 

This course is designed to test all three of these qualities: your ability, your energy and your integrity.  If we catch you cheating you have failed the test of integrity, and we will immediately drop you from from the course and ban you from any future courses.  The 3-strike rule does not apply to cheating.

#### What is Cheating?
Cheating is being dishonest about who performed the work you submit or how much time you took to do it.  For example:
- Copying chunks of code from the internet without adding a comment link to the source
- Gaining access to an assignment question before other students
- Looking up the solution to the assignment on the internet 

#### What Is Not Cheating?
It's fine to use Stack Overflow or Google to find out how to do things *which are not a large component of the assigment* - in fact this may be required for many assignments.  For example:
- You might look up the definition of the `comparator` callback function used when sorting a list (as long as testing your knowledge of the comparator function is not the main point of the assignment)
- You might Google 'javascript how to put a list of strings together separated by a comma' in order to discover the `join` method
- You might copy-and-paste a useful function from the internet, as long as you add a link to the source in the function comments and as long as the function is not the main goal of the assigment

## Weekly Workload
We expect that the workload for the average student will be around 52 hours per week.  If you are falling behind in your 
assignments you will need to spend extra time on the weekend to catch up.
 
## Frequently Asked Questions
#### Do you hire graduates as teaching assistants?
We want to avoid hiring our own graduates as TAs.  The reason is that we need to know whether our business model works - that is, whether future students who graduate can earn income on Upwork and will pay what is owed to us.  If we hired our own graduates as TAs they wouldn't be seen as a 'success' - which would make it harder for us to plan details of future courses and attract students and staff.
