# Communication

## Check for Understanding
- Say "Let me just make sure I understand"
- Describe the problem in your own words
- Walk through an example, including diagrams
- Think about edge cases


# How to fix errors?

 1. Read and try to understand error messages
 2. Compare syntax with sample code known to work
 3. Comment out code until it compiles, then slowly add code until you encounter an error
 4. Google it, then try to understand the stack overflow answer. Read the best answer, read the official documenation for method calls, etc.
 5. Print debugging (or with proper IDE debugger).
 6. Try different way to write the same logic.  For example, use standard function instead of anonymous closure (you will encounter this problem when trying to sort in reverse order)
 7. Write a simple app which demonstrates the problem, then post a question on StackOverflow with code for the sample app.  (If you cannot demonstrate the problem with a sample app, compare it to your full app which contains the error)

# Diagrams
1. Object diagrams
2. Sequence diagram
3. Algorithm sketches with example
